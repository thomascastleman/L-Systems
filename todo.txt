To do.

- extend L system lang
  - support context-sensitivity
  - stochastic grammars (we already do it, but maybe make it explicit?)

- extend graphics lang
  - forward takes a scale factor
  - change syntax for blocks
  - make sure it errors when multiple rules have same LHS (use blocks instead)

misc:
  - support custom bg color
